# redditbot
this is my reddit bot repository

my bot does not disclose it's supoprt for either political party. However, it does disclose it's support for cars.

This is my favorite thread that my bot commented on. I think its funny that it goes against the Bernie philosophy.

the following was the output of bot_counter:

```
len(comments)= 489
len(top_level_comments)= 142
len(replies)= 347
len(valid_top_level_comments)= 42
len(not_self_replies)= 344
len(valid_replies)= 338
========================================
valid_comments= 380
```

I beleive my score should be 22/20 because I completed all of the bot task, and obtained at least 100 valid comments with my bot.
